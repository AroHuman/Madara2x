Dandere2x is maintained solely by akai_katto, or me, Tyler. 

Dandere2x is extremely non-trivial and a fairly difficult problem to maintain. There’s an arbitrary infinite amount of videos out there, with more file containers that I can count on my two hands. There’s more audio formats than there are people working on the program. 

I’m very appreciative of people using the program, but understand that it’s almost impossible to account for all the variations in file types possible. Compounding with how many variations of hardware and operating systems out there, which is made worse by Windows 10 not giving me the proper permission issues, I’m dealing with a very open set of problems I have very little control over. 

Dandere2x is extremely dependent on users reporting bugs and letting me know there’s an issue for it to be fixed and known by me. I work at a fairly fast-paced startup and I commit my free energy cycles to staying healthy and happy, and allocate a part of that time into keeping dandere2x running. I’m very appreciative of the positive comments and they generally motivate me to work harder, and the contrary for negative comments: if you want something done, please remember that I’m spending my free time doing this, and make virtually zero dollars from it.
