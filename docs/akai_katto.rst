This page isn’t to serve as a resume of sorts, but rather those 1-2 people who poke around and cyberstalk developers. Hopefully you’ve landed on my page in good spirits, and not to try and find fuel to harass me with, so please be friendly with me. 

About
*****

People at work and IRL know me as Tyler, but online I go by akai_katto for convenience sake. The name is a play on “red cat” in Japanese, as a young teen my favorite animal was Red Pandas, and choosing it as an alias only felt natural.

I’ve never really written an “about” page about myself, so here it goes.

I started dandere2x during my time in community-college after having felt insecure about securing a job or an internship once I transferred to college. Looking back, Dandere2x played a very small role in pursuing a normal route of getting an internship, truthfully it would of been a better and safer path to just study leetcode like a robot, but I felt burdened by having to waste away my youth solving problems for the sake of a higher salary. I saw dandere2x as a means of getting coding experience, while slowly taking steps at building a stable future for myself. Digressing briefly, while there’s a lot of money in computer-science, it’s important to realize that the field itself isn’t fully corrupted by salary seekers, and open-source is a means for meeting other passionate coders who aren’t set on a selfish goal of financial gain, but rather interested in the community and pure aspect of the discipline. Open Source felt like a way of trying to build a career for myself, while not being corrupted by the pressures of living in a capitalist state. 

Truth be told, it played a very very minor role in hearing back from companies, granted I lacked the time to apply to many. Fortunately enough, working on dandere2x gave me a means of learning what I enjoyed about computer science, and what I didn’t enjoy, and built myself a strong foundation of getting myself started on arbitrary problems with no known solutions. Thanks to a very kind human being for giving me a chance, I found myself interning and now working at a company writing open source software. 

Outside of developing software, my hobbies include learning about virtual reality and the futures it provides for our society, learning about mathematics, both pure and applied, bike riding, and learning about the world we live in. 

Education
***********

I didn’t apply to college while I was in highschool, and instead took the community college route to discover what I wanted to do. I chose computer-science with the intention of getting into game development, but my interests change fairly rapidly. I think my end-goal was to work at Valve eventually, which is still an ongoing desire for me to build the skills needed to work on Half Life 3, but that’ll have to wait.

I transferred to UCLA Fall 2019, but I haven’t completed my degree yet. The covid-19 pandemic (I’m writing this for the future, hoping that the person reading this has forgotten the pandemic even happened) cut my undergraduate years early. I met wonderful people in my short time there, and a lot of their values are embedded within me, and I have intentions on returning when it’s practical to do so, but remote-learning was difficult for me, as well as dealing with issues like dyslexia, I found myself struggling quite a bit in school. Reading and writing in stressful situations typically resulted in words reversing or vowels being omitted, which made studying and testing a fairly difficult task.
